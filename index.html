            who builds software in her spare time because I enjoy solving
            problems, whether they are clinical or technical.
          </p>
          <p>
            By day, I work in a highly customer-focused, clinical environment
            where precision, communication, and usability genuinely matter.
            Helping people see better has taught me how small details can have a
            big impact, and that mindset carries directly into the way I
            approach software, interface design, and user experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside of work, I teach myself web development and game UI, working
            with tools like HTML, JavaScript, React, and Unity. I am especially
            drawn to building interfaces like menus, settings screens, and
            interactive systems, where logic, layout, and user flow all come
            together. I enjoy turning complex or messy ideas into things that
            feel simple, intuitive, and satisfying to use.
          </p>
          <p>
            This portfolio is a snapshot of that journey. It includes practical
            projects, experiments, and systems I have built to better understand
            how things work. I do not come from a traditional tech background,
            but I bring a strong understanding of people, real-world workflows,
            and what it feels like to actually use the things we build.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am looking to grow into a role where I can combine technical
            problem-solving with thoughtful, user-focused design and keep
            learning as I go.

                clinical environment, combining patient care with the day-to-day
                running of the practice. The role involves a lot of precision,
